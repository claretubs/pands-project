## **Introduction**
The **Iris flower data set**, otherwise known as **Fishers Iris data set** is a multivariate data set used and made famous by the British statistcian and biologist [Ronald Fisher][1] in his 1936 paper *The use of multiple measurements in taxonomic problems as an example of linear discriminant analysis*. [Multivariate statistics][2] is a branch of statistics that deals with the analysis of multiple variables at the same time. It involves studying various types of multivariate analysis and their relationships with each other. This data set has since been widely used for pattern recognition and classification tasks in various fields, including machine learning, statistics, and biology. 

Fisher's Iris data set is a well-known and widely used data set in the field of machine learning and statistics. The [data set][3] consists of 50 samples from each of three species of Iris flowers (Iris Setosa, Iris Virginicia, and Irish Versicolor). Each sample has four numerical features (sepal length, sepal width, petal length, peetal width) measured in centimeters. Tw of the three species were collected in the Gaspe Peninsula "all from the same pasture, and picked on the same day and measured at the same time by the same person with the same apparatus". The goal of the analysis is to classify the iris species based on the measurements of these four features. Based on the combination of these four features, [Fisher][4] developed a linear discriminant model to distinguish the species from eachother.

Overall, Fisher's Iris data set is a well-known and valuable resource for researchers in the field of machine learning and statistics. Its simplicity and small size make it an ideal starting point for exploring classification algorithms and statistical techniques.
